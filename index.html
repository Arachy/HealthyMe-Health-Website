                <p id="aboutUsText">
                    HealthyMe was started as group project back in college where the task was to create a business idea and present it to the class. We put our heads together and the idea we came up with was a company for diet plans, which we named HealthyMe. Since then, our passion for making healthy diets accessible for more people has only grown and so we decided to expand this idea beyond a college project and make it a reality. <br><br>We ourselves are really keen on staying fit and healthy, and eating well is a big part of staying healthy. We came up with this idea because we found that there was no form of easily finding diets that suit different needs and purposes. So, we’ve decided to provide them all in one place.

                <p class="dietText">
                    A vegan diet excludes all animal products. Many people choose to eat this way for ethical, environmental or health reasons.
                </p>
                <h3 class="innerDietHeadings">Health Benefits</h3>
                <p class="dietText">
                    Vegan diets seem very effective at helping people naturally reduce the amount of calories they eat, resulting in weight loss. They are also effective at improving markers of blood sugar control. They may lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They may also improve hearth health, but this has not yet been proven.
                </p>
                <h3 class="innerDietHeadings">Foods to Eat</h3>
                <p class="dietText">
                    Health-concious vegans substitute animal products with plant-based replacements, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Tofu, tempeh and seiten:</strong> These provide a versatile protein-rich alternative to meat, fish, poultry and eggs in many recipes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Foods such as beans, lentils and peas are excellent sources of many nutrients and beneficial plant compounds. Sprouting, fermenting and proper cooking can increase nutrient absorption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nuts and nut butter:</strong> Especially unblanched and unroasted varieties, which are good sources of iron, fiber, magnesium, zinc, selenium and vitamin E</li>
                        <li><strong>Seeds:</strong> Especially hemp, chia and flaxseeds, which contain a good amount of protein and beneficial omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
                        <li><strong>Calcium-fortified plant milks and yogurts:</strong> These help vegans achieve their recommended dietary calcium intakes. Opt for varieties also fortified with vitamins B12 and D whenever possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Algae:</strong> Spirulina and chlorella are good sources of complete protein. Other varieties are great sources of iodine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Nutritional yeast:</strong> This is an easy way to increase the protein content of vegan dishes and add an interesting cheesy flavour. Pick vitamin B12-fortified varieties whenever possible</li>
                        <li><strong>Whole grains, cereals and psuedocereals:</strong> These are a great source of complex carbs, fiber, iron, B-vitamins and several minerals. Spelt, teff, amaranth and quinora are especially high-protein options.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sprouted and fermented plant foods:</strong> Ezekiel bread, tempeh, miso, natto, sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi and kombucha often contain probiotics and vitamin K2. Sprouting and fermenting can also help improve mineral absorption.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fruit and vegetables:</strong> Both are great foods to increase your nutrient intake. Leafy greens such as bok choy, spinach, kale, watercress and mustard greens are particularly high in iron and calcium.</li>
                    </ul>

                <p class="dietText">
                    A typical low-carb diet tends to be lower in carbs and higher in protein than a typical Western diet. It usually emphasizes meats, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, vegetables, fruits and healty fats.<br><br>You're meant to minimize your intake of high-carb foods like grains, potatoes, sugary drinks, and high-sugar junk foods.<br><br>The recommended carb intake per day generally depends on your goals and preferences. A common rubric would be something like this:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>100-150 grams:</strong> This range is meant for weight maintenance or frequent high-intensity exercise. It gives room for plenty of fruit and even some starchy foods like potatoes.</li>
                        <li><strong>50-100 grams:</strong> This range is intended for slow and steady weight loss or weight maintenance. There's room for plenty of vegetables and fruit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Under 50 grams:</strong> This is geared towards fast weight loss. Eat plenty of vegetables but limit fruit intake to berries low on the glycemic index (GI).</li>
