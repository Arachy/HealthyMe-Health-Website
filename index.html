        <p id="intro">And I'm a student, currently trying to learn HTML and CSS <br>
        I am starting out as Front End Web Developer. And at the moment, this is the only website I am currently working on. I will hopefully update <br>
        this page regularly. I am also part of a group of developers that eventually want to make webpages for their clients, the group is still in the early <br> stages of being setup though, so it may take a while for that to get up and running. </p>
        
        <h2 id="links-to-other-pages">As I said, I'm fairly new to HTML and CSS, so I don't know how to make a nav-bar yet, <br> so until then here's a list of links that lead to the other pages of this website: </h2>
